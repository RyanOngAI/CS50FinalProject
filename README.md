# CS50FinalProject
There has been a strong debate in the financial industry whether asset managers deserve their yearly 2% management fee and 20% performance fee. Does active investment outperform passive investment? In this research project, I will be looking at whether a particular active investment strategy outperform the SPX (S&P500). The active investment strategy I will be using is the moving average crossover strategy. The crossover occurs when a short-term average crosses through a long-term average. This signal is used by traders to identify that momentum is shifting in one direction and that a strong move is likely approaching. A buy signal is generated when the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, while a sell signal is triggered by a short-term average crossing below a long-term average.
